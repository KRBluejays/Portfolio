This README provides a concise overview of the various projects I have been involved in, highlighting their objectives and the roles I played.

## HeartBit Project
- **Roles**: Team Leader, Product Manager
- **Year**: 2019

### Overview
The HeartBit Project aims to support elderly individuals living alone by using Fitbit devices to monitor their health. The devices track health metrics and send this information to hospitals, allowing for timely medical intervention if needed.

## Improving Nutrition in Mara, Africa
- **Roles**: Team Leader, Project Manager
- **Year**: 2021

### Overview
This project aimed to tackle the issue of malnutrition among children in the Mara region of Africa. I was responsible for organizing team communications and facilitating the exchange of ideas.

## Anomaly Detection using Machine Learning
- **Roles**: Machine Learning Developer, Product Manager
- **Year**: 2021

### Overview
In this project, we developed an algorithm to detect anomalies in data flows. The algorithm is capable of distinguishing between normal and abnormal data and sends alerts when irregularities are detected.

## Integration of CARLA Simulator with ROS
- **Roles**: Reinforcement Learning Developer, Project Manager
- **Year**: 2021

### Overview
This project involved integrating the CARLA Simulator with the Robot Operating System (ROS). We imported maps and created a simulated environment in which we could test autonomous vehicles.

## Autonomous Vehicle Training via Reinforcement Learning
- **Roles**: Reinforcement Learning Developer, Project Manager
- **Year**: 2021

### Overview
This project focused on training autonomous vehicles using reinforcement learning. Within a simulated environment, the vehicle was trained to navigate effectively by employing a well-calibrated reward system.

## News Article Classification
- **Roles**: Data Mining Specialist, Project Manager
- **Year**: 2021

### Overview
This project is about classifying news articles into different categories. We analyzed three data classification algorithms, and the Support Vector Machine (SVM) proved to be the most accurate in categorizing the news articles.

## Camera-based Object Detection for Autonomous Vehicles
- **Roles**: Researcher, Project Manager
- **Year**: 2022

### Overview
This project explores object detection in autonomous vehicles using cameras. Typically, autonomous vehicles use lidar, radar, and cameras for object detection. Our focus is on enhancing the detection accuracy of object movement by conducting research on 3D mapping and relaying that information to the vehicle for better decision-making.

## Mobility Ideas Portfolio

- **Year**: 2023

### Overview

The Mobility Ideas Portfolio is a collection of forward-thinking and innovative concepts aimed at redefining the future of transportation. This portfolio, developed in 2023, explores the potential of autonomous vehicle technology in creating new experiences for commuters and travelers. It is designed to inspire and provoke thought on how mobility can be more than just movement — it can be an extension of our living and working spaces, our personal time, and our retail experiences.

### Contents

1. **Mobile Offices**: A concept transforming travel time into productive work hours with ergonomically designed, technology-equipped mobile workspaces.
   
2. **Relaxation Pods**: Envisioning travel as a time for relaxation and rejuvenation, these pods feature customizable ambient settings, massage chairs, and wellness technologies.

3. **Retail and Showroom Experiences**: Reimagining retail in motion, this idea integrates immersive shopping and interactive product displays into the travel experience.

4. **Sleep Pods for Long Journeys**: Focused on comfort and privacy, these pods offer a peaceful sleeping environment for long-distance travelers, featuring adjustable settings and state-of-the-art safety features.
